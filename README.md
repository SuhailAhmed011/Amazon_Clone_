# Amazon_Clone_
In this repository, you'll find my rendition of an Amazon clone web application created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project replicates core Amazon functionalities, including product listings with descriptions and prices, user authentication, shopping cart management, a complete checkout process, responsive design and more.
